## Example

The included Example project showcases the funtionality of this library.

### Prerequisites

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

To run the example project you'll also need a Firebase account. Once you're account has been created, follow the instructions to create a demo project. Once your demo project has been created in your Firebase account, you'll need to download the project's corresponding `GoogleService-Info.plist` and add it the demo project. The Firebase framework automatically detects this file when the app launches, and will configure the environment accordingly.
